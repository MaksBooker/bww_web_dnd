            <hr class="subsection-uderscore">
            <div class="main-text">
                <p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn
                abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Constitution score
                increases by 2.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Age.</b> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans,
                but they’re considered young until they reach the
                age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Alignment.</b> Most dwarves are lawful, believing
                firmly in the benefits of a well-­‐‑ordered society. They
                tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair
                play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in
                the benefits of a just order.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Size.</b> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and
                average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your
                speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Darkvision.</b> Accustomed to life underground, you
                have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
                can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
                bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
                You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of
                gray.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Dwarven Resilience.</b> You have advantage on
                saving throws against poison, and you have
                resistance against poison damage.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Dwarven Combat Training.</b> You have proficiency
                with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and
                warhammer.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Tool Proficiency.</b> You gain proficiency with the
                artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s
                supplies, or mason’s tools.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Stonecunning.</b> Whenever you make an
                Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of
                stonework, you are considered proficient in the
                History skill and add double your proficiency bonus
                to the check, instead of your normal proficiency
                bonus.</p>
                
                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write
                Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard
                consonants and guttural sounds, and those
                characteristics spill over into whatever other
                language a dwarf might speak.</p>

                <h4 class="mini-caption">Hill Dwarf</h4>

                <p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition,
                and remarkable resilience.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Wisdom score
                increases by 1.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Dwarven Toughness.</b> Your hit point maximum
                increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you
                gain a level.</p>

        <div class="section-content-container">
            <h2 class="section-title">Elf</h2>
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Elf Traits</h3>
            <hr class="subsection-uderscore">
            <div class="main-text">
                <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities,
                the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Dexterity score
                increases by 2.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Age.</b> Although elves reach physical maturity at
                about the same age as humans, the elven
                understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical
                growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf
                typically claims adulthood and an adult name
                around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years
                old.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Alignment.</b> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-­‐‑
                expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler
                aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’
                freedom as well as their own, and they are more
                often good than not.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Size.</b> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall
                and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>

                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
                
                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Darkvision.</b> Accustomed to twilit forests and the
                night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim
                conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of
                you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it
                were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness,
                only shades of gray.</p>
                
                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Keen Senses.</b> You have proficiency in the
                Perception skill.</p>
                
                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Fey Ancestry.</b> You have advantage on saving
                throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put
                you to sleep.</p>
                
                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Trance.</b> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they
                meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4
                hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation
                is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a
                fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises
                that have become reflexive through years of practice.
                After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit
                that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
                
                <p class="bold-paragraph"><b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write
                Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle
                intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature
                is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are
                famous among other races. Many bards learn their
                language so they can add Elvish ballads to their
                repertoires.</p>
